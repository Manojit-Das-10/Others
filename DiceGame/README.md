🎲 **Rolling into React with a Fun Dice Game Project!** 🎲

I've been diving deeper into React by working on a mini project that’s as engaging as it is educational—a dice game! 🕹️ 

Here's how it works:
1. **Roll the Dice:** A number between 1-6 is randomly generated.
2. **Select Your Number:** Pick a number from 0-6. 
3. **Match to Score:** If the number on the dice matches your selected number, you score points equal to the dice roll. If not, you lose 2 points. 🏆

This project has been a great way to understand React’s core concepts, state management, and conditional rendering. Plus, I had fun designing and styling it in Figma!

Excited to keep rolling (pun intended) with more React projects! 🚀

Would love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions for improvement!
